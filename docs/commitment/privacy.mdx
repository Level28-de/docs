## Protecting Student Privacy with GDPR Compliance

### Privacy as a Core Value

As a European company, we hold privacy in the highest regard, particularly regarding safeguarding students. In today’s digital age, students must have a space where their data is secure and cannot be exploited. At Eltepi, we believe privacy isn’t just a feature — it’s a fundamental right. We are committed to providing an environment where students can engage without fear of their personal information being misused.

### Untraceable and Secure Data Storage

Eltepi is engineered with privacy at its core, ensuring that all data stored on our servers is anonymized and cannot be mapped back to any individual. By separating personal information from data storage, we ensure that even in the unlikely event of unauthorized access, there is no way to identify or exploit user data. This meticulous design reflects our commitment to protecting your privacy from every angle.

### Safe Social Network Features

All social network features within Eltepi are crafted with student safety as the top priority. We have implemented robust protections that guard against unwanted exposure and ensure that interactions remain secure. Our features are designed to foster community and connection while maintaining strict safeguards, so students can engage freely, knowing their privacy is fully protected.
