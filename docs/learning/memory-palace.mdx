## Experience accelerated learning progress with eltepi's innovative use of the memory palace technique, proven to improve retention of new vocabulary

At eltepi, we are constantly striving to develop innovative approaches to language-learning that can help students succeed.

## Learn In Space

That's why we've included the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">memory palace technique</a></b> in our learning algorithm, which is an effective way to accelerate learning progress.

## Building Memory even faster

The memory palace technique involves using familiar locations or objects as mental anchors to help students remember new information. By linking new vocabulary to these familiar references, students can more easily commit the words to memory.

## Smart through science

By incorporating the memory palace technique into our learning algorithm, we've created a powerful tool that can help students retain new vocabulary and make progress faster. Try it out today and see the difference it can make in your language-learning journey!
