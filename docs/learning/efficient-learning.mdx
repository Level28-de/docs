## Experience efficient learning algorithm and achieve your goals with up to 70% less repetition than traditional methods

The eltepi app is built using the latest learning science to help students learn vocabulary effectively and efficiently.

## Leitner System

Our intelligent learning algorithm is based on the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leitner system</a></b>, which presents students with learning cards that need more repetition to reach the next learning level.

## Save Time

This approach is more efficient than <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rote repetition</a></b>, as it allows students to focus their efforts on the most important material and achieve better results in less time. In fact, studies have shown that students using the eltepi app can reach their learning goals with up to 70% less repetition compared to traditional rote learning methods.
