## Smart Repetition

Using this feature, the app will present students with learning cards at predetermined intervals to refresh their knowledge. The eltepi learning algorithm calculates the time between repetitions for each card based on the student's learning confidence, ensuring that only the content that needs to be refreshed is presented. This efficient approach allows students to continuously build and maintain their knowledge in a time-effective manner.

With the Long-Term Memory feature, you can take control of your learning journey and persist content in your long-term memory for successful language learning. Try it out today and see the difference it can make!
