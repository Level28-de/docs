## Scientific Methods

Studies have shown that our brains are wired to remember images better than text alone, thanks to the Pictorial Superiority Effect <b><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/how-brain-helps-us-remember-what-weve-seen-0208" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(National Geographic Learning)</a></b>.

By using our pre-selected options, you can leverage this powerful effect to enhance your learning experience.

## Build Bridges

In addition to our pre-selected options, you can also add your own text or emojis as mnemonic aids to personalize your learning experience. This way, you can make your content more memorable and have more fun while you learn!
