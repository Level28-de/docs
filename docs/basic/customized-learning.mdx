## Deck

A deck is a collection of learning units for a specific language.

## Unit

Each unit is made up of vocabulary cards, and students can add new units to their deck at any time. The progress shown is on a unit-by-unit basis, so students can easily track their progress as they work through their studies.

## Cards

Each card consists of a source word and a target word, and students can add additional information like images or mnemonics to help them learn more effectively. By building their own decks, students have complete control over the content they want to learn and can tailor their studies to their specific needs and goals.
